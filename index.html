    <h2>Do You Want to Know Who the Next Nate Bargatze Is?</h2>
    <p><strong>Ask Nate Bargatze.</strong></p>

    <p>If you’re not already watching Aaron Weber, pause whatever you’re doing — including reading this — and hit play on his new special, <em>Signature Dish</em>, streaming now on YouTube. It's the first full-length special under the <em>Nateland</em> banner, and Aaron’s the first guy through the gate. That tells you everything you need to know.</p>
    <p>I met him one night at Zanies in Nashville — totally unplanned — and he blew me away. He’s not flashy, not gimmicky. He just writes and performs like someone who’s been doing it for 20 years. Smart, steady, honest comedy. A true pro.</p>
    <p>So who is Aaron Weber? He’s the third chair on Nate's podcast, <em>Nateland</em>, and the guy who looks like he might also run a bait shop on weekends. But his jokes? Tight. Timed. Terrific.</p>
    <p><strong>Signature Dish</strong> is everything great about clean comedy — and harder to do than most people think. It’s a real calling card. And it proves Aaron's got the stuff to headline theaters and build a huge fanbase.</p>
